Data Visualization in JavaScript

##### Goal
The goal of this project is to create Data Visualization for the web. 
Visualizing data is used in order to communicate findings to an audience. 

##### Task
Will be testing a hypothesis that states that the ideal bacteria species to make synthetic beef may be found in the human bellybutton.
To test the hypothesis, data has been collected on individuals across the nation who have been sampled for naval bacteria species.
Each person’s identity is anonymous, they have been instead assigned an ID number. 

##### Approach
Build a dashboard that both the research participants and fellow researchers can access. Those who participated in the research study can visit the website and select their ID numbers to see what bacteria lives in their navels. Using the power of JavaScript to create data visualizations that are attractive, accessible and interactive. Plotly.js a JavaScript data visualization library offers interactivity 
and increases audience comprehension. JavaScript allows for manipulating, parsing and transforming data. 
Interactive features such as buttons, drop down menus as well as retrieving data from external sources such as CSV files and API’s, 
as well as deploying a polished data visualization to the web is all possible through JavaScript.
